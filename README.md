## About

Hey, I'm **Atharva Devasthali** — a developer who learns by doing.

ADevLogs is where I document what I discover while building real-world software. From debugging production issues at 2 AM to experimenting with new frameworks on weekends, this space captures the raw, unfiltered journey of a developer constantly pushing boundaries.

## What You'll Find Here

**Dev Logs** — Deep dives into problems I've solved, architectural decisions I've made, and lessons learned the hard way.

**Articles** — Polished pieces on topics I've explored thoroughly — tutorials, guides, and technical breakdowns.

**Projects** — Behind-the-scenes looks at side projects and experiments.

## Philosophy

I believe the best learning happens when you're building something real. Every bug is a lesson. Every failed deployment is a story. Every refactor teaches you something about your past self.

This isn't about perfection — it's about progress.
